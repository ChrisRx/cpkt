cpkt
====

An easy to read (and extend) low-level packet parsing/crafting library.  Inspired heavliy by the wonderful dpkt, however, with the goal of creating something more readable (even at the cost of speed).  The thought is that using python for parsing packets is already too heavy a task for an serious packet based need, but sometimes flexibility is desired when investigating and troubleshooting pcaps.
